### Project Overview
This project implements the calculation of quantum system coherence using machine learning methods.
### File Usage Instructions
- **Data Generation (`.m` files)**:
  - **Files**: `genDensityCoherenceData4d.m`, `genDensityCoherenceData6d.m`, `genDensityCoherenceData8d.m`
   - **Description**: These MATLAB scripts generate datasets for training Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. The suffixes `4d`, `6d`, and `8d` indicate the dimensions of the matrices used. You can configure the number of data points, pure states, mixed states, etc., within the programs. Detailed instructions and annotations are included in each script.
   
- **Non-Markov Data (`non-Markov.m`)**:
   - **Description**: This file contains datasets generated by non-Markov processes.
   
- **Machine Learning (`.ipynb` files)**:
   - **Description**: After importing the data produced by the models or processes into Python programs (with the `.ipynb` extension), the program constructs and trains the necessary ANN using the imported data.
          
- **Model Storage**:
  - **Description**: The trained models can be stored in the `.keras` format. Details of the neural network construction and complete annotations are provided in the program section.

 The projectâ€™s ultimate goal is to use machine learning to accurately calculate quantum system coherence.
